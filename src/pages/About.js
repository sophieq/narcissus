                        Iâ€™m a 3rd year Computer Science student at the
                        University of Waterloo with a passion for women
                        empowerment and coding for social good.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I love learning and I'd like to think I have a knack for
                        picking up new skills. With experience as a mobile
                        developer, I hope to grow my knowledge in machine
                        learning, backend and web development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of coding, I spend my days discovering new
                        music, reading, in a Zumba class or getting scared by
                        true crime podcasts.
                    </p>
